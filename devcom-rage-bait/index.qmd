## Social Media

### Platform

- Female students are more active across diverse platforms, while male students concentrate usage on fewer platforms.

- Females reported higher usage across nearly all platforms, with Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram as their top three.

- Males also favored Facebook, but their engagement was lower overall, with Instagram and TikTok following.

### Social media content engagement by gender

- Gender differences highlight that females lean toward lifestyle and advocacy, while males gravitate more toward gaming and politics.

- Females engaged most with entertainment, music, and lifestyle content, followed by news and educational posts.

- Males showed similar interest in entertainment and music but had stronger engagement with gaming content compared to females.

plt_subtitle <- str_wrap("Entertainment, music, and lifestyle content were the most engaged categories among female students, while males showed stronger engagement with entertainment, music, and gaming; overall, females reported higher engagement across most content types.", 140)

### Social media content engagement by platform

- Regardless of platform, students prioritize light, entertaining, and lifestyle-driven content, with serious topics less dominant.

- Across platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube), entertainment, music, and lifestyle consistently ranked highest.

- Educational and news content also attracted significant engagement, while politics and gaming were lower overall.

plt_subtitle <- str_wrap("Across platforms, entertainment, music, and lifestyle content consistently drew the highest engagement, with Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube showing similar patterns; educational and news content also ranked strongly, while politics and gaming remained lower overall.", 120)

### Daily time spent on social media by platform

- Heavy usage patterns suggest social media is deeply embedded in daily routines, with some platforms fostering extended engagement.

- Majority of students spend 3–6 hours daily on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.

- A notable proportion also reported more than 6 hours, especially on platforms like Reddit, X (Twitter), and Tumblr.



```{r}

# plot subtitle
plt_subtitle <- str_wrap("Most students reported spending 3–6 hours daily on social media, with Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube showing the highest sustained use; a notable share of users also exceeded 6 hours, highlighting heavy engagement across platforms.", 120)

### Daily time spent on social media by platform

- Male students demonstrate more extreme usage, while female students cluster around moderate-to-high daily engagement

- Females most often reported 3–6 hours daily, with fewer exceeding 6 hours.

- Males were more likely to report over 6 hours of use, showing heavier overall consumption.

```{r}
# plot subtitle
plt_subtitle <- str_wrap("Female students most often reported spending 3–6 hours daily on social media, while males were more likely to exceed 6 hours; overall, both groups showed heavy usage concentrated in the mid-to-high ranges.", 100)
